# bta_deep_hole_drilling
My project centered around BTA deep hole drilling, where I employed essential data science techniques, including time series analysis, stationary processes, autocorrelation functions, and fast Fourier transformation. I have prepared a comprehensive report in PDF format along with accompanying R code for my BTA deep hole drilling project.
